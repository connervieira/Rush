# Rush

Version 0.1

An open source platform for linking independent business, delivery drivers, and customers using cryptocurrency.

*Note: Rush isn't currently functional, and has no real functionality at the moment. This document explains features that may not be implemented yet.*


## Description

Rush is an open source platform that's designed to connect businesses, delivery drivers, and customers. Rush strives to be the ethical alternative to proprietary services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and GrubHub.


## Terminology

There's a few terms associated with Rush that you should know to better understand how it works.

### Server

A Rush server is the central platform that powers Rush. Users connect to this server in order to use Rush. Users can connect to a Rush server just like they'ed connect to any other website on the internet.

### Client

A Rush client is just a device that connects to the Rush server. When a someone enters a Rush server into their browser and connects to it, that device becomes a client.

### Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses cryptography and math to process transactions independently of a central authority. In other words, cryptocurrency is a community based way to send money without having to trust a single central authority, like your bank or a site like PayPal.

### Role

A Rush 'role' is just the role a user takes, whether that be a customer, driver, or business. Customers are users that purchase products, businesses are users that sell them, and drivers are the users that deliver those product. Only customers and drivers are actually necessary for Rush to function, but businesses can sign up to add additional information for their businesses that might be useful in the context of Rush deliveries, like whether or not their product needs to be refrigerated and whether it can be safely driven by an untrained delivery driver.

### Source Code

'Source code', is just the code behind a particular piece of software. If a program is 'open source', that means anyone can see the code behind it.


## The Issues

All of the existing prominent platforms that facilitate deliveries, like DoorDash, GrubHub, and Uber Eats, collectively have a few significant issues.

### Anti-Competition

These proprietary services use their dominant position to charge businesses, drivers, and customers extremely high fees, making it near impossible for small busineses and individuals to compete with larger companies.

### Privacy

Every widely available delivery platform is completely proprietary, and requires personal information to be used. Not only do you need to enter your personal information to order a $10 meal, but you aren't permitted to inspect how this information is being handled.

### The Environment

This is a less significant issue than the others covered so far, but it's still something to take note of. Existing delivery platforms almost always require modern devices, and consume unnecessary power and resources. If a business wants to support a certain delivery service, they can't just use an old device that's bound for the garbage. They have to purchase a new, modern device, keep it powered 24/7, and always leave it connected to the internet. Even if a business only makes a few deliveries a day, they still have to leave all of their equipment active. While a business throwing out an old tablet doesn't do too much to harm the environment in itself, hundreds of thousands of businesses and individuals doing it can have major ramifications.

## Solutions

Rush aims to solve these issues in a few unique ways.

### Unrestrictive

Rush is completely open, and doesn't charge any fees. Rush only aims to be a middleman to connect drivers, customers, and businesses, so all 3 roles can focus on their job, and not have to worry about being forced to pay predatory fees. Rush uses cryptocurrency, further ensuring fees are kept to just a few cents, even including payment processing services.

### Open Source and Anonymous

Rush is completely open source, meaning anyone is free to look at the code that makes it function. This makes it nearly impossible to hide privacy invasive systems that collect and sell user information. Rush is also designed to be completely anonymous, so that customers, drivers, and businesses don't have to provide unnecessary information.

### Lightweight

Rush is designed to use as little resources as possible, and doesn't have any unnecessary assets or functionality that consumes un-needed power. Rush is also deliberately designed to work on old devices just as well as new ones. While Rush is modern and easy to use, businesses and individuals won't have to replace the old devices they already have just to use Rush. That being said, Rush is fully compatible with the latest devices as well, should businesses already have purchased new devices for use with other platforms.


## Features

While simple and purpose built, Marathon is a feature rich platform.

### Transparent

Rush is completely open source and can be freely studied, inspected, modified, and shared. Unlike proprietary alternatives, with Rush, you know exactly how your data is being handled.

### No Fees

Rush isn't profit based, and doesn't charge fees to business, customers, or drivers. When you make or receive a payment over Rush, the only fees you'll have are the fees associated with the cryptocurrency network.

### Direct

Rush doesn't restrict you to the platform, and only serves as a way to automatically facilitate connections between customers, drivers, and business. This means that Rush doesn't monitor your location or transactions, and can't even if it tried!

### Anonymous

Rush doesn't require you to verify your identity. Whether you're a customer, driver, or business, all that's required to use Rush is a username and password. In this way, Rush is just as private as walking into a store and buying something with cash yourself.

### Cryptocurrency Based

Rush uses cryptocurrency, specifically Monero. Monero is a privacy respecting coin with low transaction fees and a completely open source software stack.

### Backwards Compatible

Rush doesn't need JavaScript or any other technologies outdated devices might struggle with. This lowers the barrier of entry, and prevents users from having to purchase no devices to be a driver, business, or customer.

### Free

Rush is free both in terms of freedom and cost. Rush can be easily use with any device that can use a web browser, and doesn't have any service fees or restrictions of any kind.

### Self Hostable

Rush doesn't depend on any external services, and is lightweight enough to be self hosted on inexpensive hardware.

### Accessibility

Rush is designed to be fully accessible, and makes very limited use of colors and transparency in contexts that could make it difficult for a user with limited vision to use the sight. Rush is also designed to work well with screen readers for users who have no use of their vision at all.

### Secure

Rush processes all payments on the cryptocurrency networks themselves, meaning it's as secure as your own wallet, and doesn't introduce any additional points of attack.

### Lightweight

Rush doesn't have any large assets or complicated webpages that consume unnecessary data and processing power. All Rush pages are modern and easy to use, but don't waste unnecessary resources on animations and large images. Due to Rush's unique design, there's also no need for background network usage, even further limiting how much data Rush needs to function. This makes it easy to use Rush on the go, even on limited data plans.

### Environmentally Friendly

Due to the lightweight nature of Rush, it can be run comfortable on extremely low power consumption devices. Even a full blown Rush server can by run on a Raspberry Pi, a single board computer that's so effient that it can be run off a hand-held solar panel.

### Generic

Due to Rush's generic structure, it isn't limited to any one type of product. Instead of just being on food or home goods delivery, Rush can facilitate the delivery of any product type that drivers are willing and have the means to transport.

### Non Historical

Rush doesn't keep track of transactions or user interactions, meaning it's impossible to inspect the history of users and purchases. Even if Rush gets compromised, the attackers won't get access to any of your financial information or purchase history.


## Downfalls

While Rush's design has plenty of advantages, it also introduces several downfalls you should be aware of before using the service.

### Non Custodial

Rush is non-custodial, meaning it doesn't hold onto money to complete payments. All transactions are directly between users. While this improves privacy, transparency, and security, it introduces the possibility of scams. You should only transact with people you trust to avoid a driver or business running off with your payment without honoring the order.

### Fragmented

Since Rush is open source and can be self hosted, there's nothing preventing multiple instances of Rush from being active under different authorities. This means that there might be issues related to fragmentation, where different users all use different instances of Rush, effectively preventing any individual instance from facilitating connections between users.
