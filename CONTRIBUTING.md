# Contributing Guidelines

This document describes the guidelines for contributing code to the Rush project.

- Rush is primarily an English project, so comments and other text should be written in English with proper grammar and punctuation where appropriate.
- Use extensive use of comments to ensure other developers understand what your code is doing.
- All code should be self contained, and never depend on external services and proprietary libraries.
    - To put it in other words, Rush should be completely functional without a connection to the external internet.
- Before making significant changes, contact the head developer using the information at <https://v0lttech.com/contact.php> to ensure your changes are appropriate.
- Keep code organized by using line breaks to separate code into managable chunks.
- Proprietary code, DRM, and trackers are any kind are not acceptable in Rush and any changes involving them will be rejected.
- For legal reasons, the Rush platform should not use any content or code from DoorDash, GrubHub, Uber Eats, or other delivery services.
    - This includes logos and other branding materials.
