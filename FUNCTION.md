# Function

Rush uses a comparatively straight forward method for connecting users. This document explains the process in less technical terms.

## Customers

This is the process that a customer will follow during normal usage of Rush. Due to Rush's open nature, this isn't necessarily a concrete process, and is open to change depending on what the customer and driver want.

1. A customer signs in and selects the "Customer" role.
2. The customer finds a driver who is near them and near the business they would like to purchase from.
3. They select the driver, and submit a request.
4. Assuming the driver accepts, they establish communication with them to work out details, like when payment will be made, and by what time the delivery will be completed.
5. Depending on the agreement with the driver, the customer may making a full or partial payment before the delivery begins.
6. The driver completes the order, and arrives with the product at the customer's desired location.
7. Any remaining payments are made, and the customer receives the product.
8. The customer rates the driver to improve their reputation. This helps reduce the likelihood of scams.

## Drivers

This is the process that a driver will follow during normal usage of Rush. Due to Rush's open nature, this isn't necessarily a concrete process, and is open to change depending on what the customer and driver want.

1. The driver signs in and selects the "Driver" role.
2. The driver configures their information for the session, like their current location, their pricing, and how far they are willing to travel.
3. The driver receives a request from a customer.
4. The driver reviews the customer's reputation.
5. The driver and customer establish contact, and work out the details for a delivery, like when payment will be made, and by what time the delivery will be completed.
6. Depending on the agreement with the customer, the driver may receive full or partial payment before the delivery starts.
    - Typically a customer will pay for the product itself before the delivery, then pay the driver fee after receiving the product.
8. If the business the customer wants to purchase from is signed in to Rush, the driver may look to see information the business wants them to know, like whether or not their product has certain transport requirements.
9. The driver travels to the business and purchases the product that the customer wants.
10. The driver delivers the product to the customer's desired location.
11. Any remaining payments are made, and the customer receives the product.
12. The driver rates their customer to improve their reputation. This helps reduce the likelihood of scams.

## Businesses

This is the process that a business will follow during normal usage of Rush. Due to the process Rush uses to organize deliveries, businesses are not necessary for the platform to function, but businesses have the option to set up a profile that gives drivers and customers important information.

1. A business signs in and selects the "Business" role.
2. The business configures information related to their business, like whether their products have specific shipping requirements, and what hours they are open. Unlike customers and drivers, businesses do not need to be signed in to be actively displayed on Rush.
